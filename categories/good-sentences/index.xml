      <description>from 《blackhole》@Netflix
   I thought there are very interesting things in the universe to be explored.
  You really need to be above the atmosphere to see through to the emptiness space.
  We&amp;rsquo;re gonna take the first picture of a blackhole.
  It&amp;rsquo;s like a vortex in the universe in space and time. The darkest object we can imagine mathematically and fundamentally.
  That means that the basic nature of the universe is just random.</description>

      <description> from 《a perfect pairing》@Netflix
  Let&amp;rsquo;s go a lot of bold and a little crazy.  让我们冒进疯狂一点吧。
 Uh, right. That&amp;rsquo;s why you&amp;rsquo;re snooping around her house.  是哦，所以你在她家里窥探？
 Charm doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on me.  卖萌对我不管用。
  Australian sun shows no mercy.
  I learned the hard way. Once bitten, twice shy.
  吃过苦头才明白，一朝被蛇咬，十年怕井绳。
 I have no word but &amp;lsquo;wow&amp;rsquo;.  </description>

      <description>from 《The surgeon&amp;rsquo;s cut》@Netflix
   I wanted to devote my life towards understanding how we can save the baby in situations where the baby would otherwise die.
  He has been a pioneer.
  From my perspective, that is a very simple gesture which engages them. We are undertaking the procedure together.
  You know, I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to hold them and be a dad.</description>
